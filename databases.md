# Discipline-Specific Database Recommendations

## General Principle

Select 2-3 primary databases per discipline identified in user's text. Use multilingual queries (English/Russian/German/French as appropriate). Always add universal checks for Russian texts, books, theses, and known paywalled works.

## Universal Checks (Always Add Where Appropriate)

### Russian-Language Texts
Add these databases when user's text or target literature is in Russian:
- **CyberLeninka** — Russian scientific articles (open access)
- **eLibrary.ru** — Russian scientific literature database
- **philosophy.ru** — Russian philosophy (texts, articles, books)
- **Socionet** — Russian social sciences repository

### Book/Monograph References
When user mentions books or monographs:
- **Internet Archive** — vast collection of digitized books
- **OAPEN** — Open Access books (humanities/social sciences)
- **DOAB** (Directory of Open Access Books)
- **OpenEdition Books** — humanities and social sciences books
- **Wikisource** — free library of published works

### Thesis/Dissertation Mentions
When user's text references dissertations or theses:
- **OATD** (Open Access Theses and Dissertations)
- **NDLTD** (Networked Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations)
- **Dissercat** (RU) — Russian dissertations catalog

### Known Paywalled Works
When you identify a paywalled work, search for OA version via:
- **Unpaywall** — finds OA versions of paywalled articles
- **OA Button** — community-driven OA finder
- **Crossref** — metadata verification and DOI resolution

## Search Strategy

### Multilingual Queries
- **English:** primary language for most international databases
- **Russian:** for CyberLeninka, eLibrary.ru, philosophy.ru, Socionet
- **German:** for German philosophy, theory (especially Heidegger, Habermas, Luhmann)
- **French:** for French theory (Foucault, Derrida, Latour, Stiegler)

### Controlled Vocabulary and Synonyms
Use discipline-specific terms and synonyms:
- **Philosophy:** pharmakon, Gestell, épiphylogenèse, différance, apparatus
- **STS:** actor-network theory, infrastructure studies, technoscience, ontological turn
- **Media theory:** remediation, media ecology, cultural techniques, technological determinism
- **Social theory:** governmentality, biopower, audit culture, risk society

### Coverage Requirements
- **Cover ALL major themes** identified in text analysis (Step 2)
- **Include ALL named authors** mentioned in user's text
- **Add foundational works** even if not explicitly mentioned (if central to topic)
- **For Russian texts:** prioritize Russian-language scholarship first, then key originals
